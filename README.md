Most public repositories can be downloaded for free, without even a user account. This is because public repositories are considered to be codebases that are open source. That said, unless the owner of the codebase checks a box otherwise, their codebase can be downloaded onto your computer, packed into a .zip file.

* So, if you go to a public codebase — such as this Tip Calculator that I built — you’ll notice that in the top-right corner is a green button that says Clone or Download, click on the button.

* Then, in the dropdown, select Download ZIP. All of the files will begin downloading to your computer, usually in your Downloads folder.

* Then, open your Downloads folder on your computer and find the ZIP file. You’ll want to right-click it and choose the option that says Extract All…, Unzip, or Uncompress, and then select a folder where you want the files to end up.

* Finally, navigate to that selected folder, and you’ll find all of those Github files that we downloaded right there!
